We uphold the principle of making everything transparent, and let customers understand our technology and our team, so that customers can make their final correct decisions.
The ChatChatABC team is still relatively young, and we cannot provide customers with good business and commercial advice, but we hope to help customers with the technology we know and are good at.

Software development involves a wide range of people and technologies. At present, the picture on the right is the technology stack we are relatively good at. Here we also give some brief introductions to facilitate customers to have a comprehensive understanding.

##### Site Development

For the websites and sites of small and medium-sized companies, we recommend customers to adopt more flexible and lightweight technology stacks, such as Astro, Next.js, etc., mainly because the development is fast and the cost of deployment is relatively low.
We provide comprehensive site development services including website design, website development, website deployment, website maintenance and more.

##### Java Technology Stack

Java is still the mainstream of enterprise application development, and it is also the main development language of many large companies. For some enterprise applications or large-scale projects, we recommend customers to adopt a more mature Java technology stack, so that the risk will be lower and more efficient. Good guarantee the quality of the item.
The technical partner of ChatChatABC has 22 years of experience in Java development, and we can provide more professional advice in terms of technology and architecture design.

##### Cloud Technology

At present, more projects adopt the cloud native (Cloud Native) architecture. We also believe that this is the trend of the future architecture. We have made preparations for this, and fully support the needs of customers in this regard from technical architecture to operation and maintenance deployment.

##### JavaScript/TypeScript full stack

JavaScript/TypeScript is currently the most popular development language, and this trend will not change in a short time. For some start-ups or innovative projects, we recommend that customers adopt a JS/TS-based full-stack technology architecture, and in fact we do the same.
On the one hand, the development efficiency is high. In addition, considering the better support of JS/WebAssembly on the serverless platform, the cost of hosting and operation and maintenance is also very low.

##### Architecture Design

At present, we mainly adopt Domain Driven Design, and of course we will also combine architectural patterns such as Hexagonal Architecture, Event Driven Architecture and CQRS. We use this pattern in both Java and TypeScript projects.
We also hope that our accumulation in this area can help customers better design and develop software projects.

##### Others

In some other fields, we are also making some attempts, such as Rust and Golang. We are also constantly learning and exploring these technology stacks. If customers have needs in this regard, we can also provide some help, but we can only It is a supporting role and cannot provide more professional advice.
