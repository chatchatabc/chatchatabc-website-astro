JavaScript/TypeScript is currently the most popular development language, and this trend will not change in a short time. For some start-ups or innovative projects, we recommend that customers adopt a JS/TS-based full-stack technology architecture, and in fact we do the same.
On the one hand, the development efficiency is high. In addition, considering the better support of JS/WebAssembly on the serverless platform, the cost of hosting and operation and maintenance is also very low.
