At present, we mainly adopt Domain Driven Design, and of course we will also combine architectural patterns such as Hexagonal Architecture, Event Driven Architecture and CQRS. We use this pattern in both Java and TypeScript projects.
We also hope that our accumulation in this area can help customers better design and develop software projects.
