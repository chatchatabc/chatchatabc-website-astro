title: Java Study RoadMap
summary: For many Java beginners, the threshold for learning Java is not low. If you have not participated in a specific Java project and have no good guidance, then the threshold for learning may be particularly high, and of course a lot of time will be wasted. In the end, I didn't understand whether what I learned could be applied to the project.
summary_zh: 对于很多Java初学者来说，学习Java的门槛并不低，如果你没有参与到特定的Java项目中，没有好的指导，那么学习的门槛可能会特别高，当然也会浪费非常多的时间，最后也没有明白自己学的东西到底能否应用到项目中。

[//]: # (如果你想学习Java的话，不用担心，材料非常多，有非常多的图书，非常多的视频，而且一些Java开源产品的文档非常不错，如Spring, Hibernate, Jakarta EE等。)

[//]: # (如果按部就班来学，一来非常枯燥，二来学习到的知识可能在实际的工作中用不到，所以结合实际的项目，我们整理出一份针对实际项目开发的Java学习路线图，希望对你有所帮助。)

If you want to learn Java, don't worry, there are a lot of materials, a lot of books, a lot of videos, and the documentation of some Java open source products is very good, such as Spring, Hibernate, Jakarta EE, etc.
If you learn step by step, firstly it is very boring, and secondly, the knowledge you have learned may not be used in actual work. Therefore, combined with actual projects, we have compiled a Java learning roadmap for actual project development. I hope it will be helpful to you. helps.

[//]: #(当然Java的基础知识你还是要加强的，我们只是希望通过项目中真实需要用到的知识点，来反向帮助你更好的学习Java，但这不代表Java的基础知识不重要，基础知识是必须要掌握的。)

Of course, you still need to strengthen the basic knowledge of Java. We just hope to reversely help you learn Java better through the knowledge points that are really needed in the project, but this does not mean that the basic knowledge of Java is not important. Basic knowledge is must be mastered.
