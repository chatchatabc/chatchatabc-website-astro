### Island Architecture

Astro Island: refers to an interactive UI component on an otherwise static page of HTML. Multiple islands can exist on a page, and an island always renders in isolation.
Think of them as islands in a sea of static, non-interactive HTML.

In short, you can use Astro to build a website that has a lot of interactive UI components, and these components could be built with any framework you want, such as React.js, Svelte, Vue.js etc.

### SSR or SSG

SSR(Server Side Rendering) or SSG(Static Site Generation) is a way to render your website.
SSR is a way to render your website on the server, and SSG is a way to render your website on the build time.

We choose SSG because we want to build a website that we can pay less for hosting, and website can be loaded faster to avoid unnecessary network calls from the server.
How to reduce JavaScript code size?  This is another reason why we choose Astro: ship Less JavaScript and more HTML.
