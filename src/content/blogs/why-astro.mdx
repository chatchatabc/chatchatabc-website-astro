### Introduction

Astro is a powerful JAMstack framework that helps developers to build a great content-based website for their projects. Astro is mainly known for its great versatile architecture and easy-to-use technologies that ensure a great developer experience when developing a project website. In ChatChatABC, most of the time we choose Astro to build a website, and we will explain why we choose Astro and why you should also use it for your next project. Let's start!

### Features

We know that there are a lot of different JAMstack out there aside from Astro, such as Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt.js, Hugo, etc., but how does Astro stand out from the rest? Here are some of the cool features that Astro has in their system:

- Component Islands: A new web architecture for building faster websites.
- Server-first API design: Move expensive hydration off of your users’ devices.
- Zero JS, by default: No JavaScript runtime overhead to slow you down.
- Edge-ready: Deploy anywhere, even a global edge runtime like Deno or Cloudflare.
- Customizable: Tailwind, MDX, and 100+ other integrations to choose from.
- UI-agnostic: Supports React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit and more.
- Content Collections: Type-Safe Markdown

### Island Architecture

One of the cool things about Astro is that made them different from any other JAMstack frameworks out there is their unique web architecture that they call **`"Astro Island"`**.

Astro Island: refers to an interactive UI component on an otherwise static page of HTML. Multiple islands can exist on a page, and an island always renders in isolation. Think of it like an island in a sea of static HTML.

In short, you can use Astro to build a website that has a lot of interactive UI components, and these components could be built with any framework you want, such as React.js, Svelte, Vue.js etc.

### SSR or SSG

SSR(Server Side Rendering) or SSG(Static Site Generation) is a way to render your website.
SSR is a way to render your website on the server, and SSG is a way to render your website on the build time.

We choose SSG because we want to build a website that we can pay less for hosting, and website can be loaded faster to avoid unnecessary network calls from the server.
How to reduce JavaScript code size? This is another reason why we choose Astro: ship Less JavaScript and more HTML.

### Zero JS, by default

The right website provides a great user experience, improves SEO, reduces bounce rates, increases engagement, and makes the whole thing faster.

1. **Improved User Experience**: A fast website provides a better user experience, as users can quickly access the content they want without waiting for slow page loads or experiencing lag.

2. **Reduced Bounce Rates**: A fast website can reduce bounce rates, as users are less likely to leave the website if it loads quickly and provides a good experience.

3. **Better SEO**: Google and other search engines consider page load speed as a ranking factor, so a fast website can improve its search engine ranking and visibility.

4. **Increased Engagement**: A fast website can increase engagement, as users are more likely to spend more time on a website that loads quickly and provides a good experience.

5. **Improved Mobile Experience**: With the growing use of mobile devices to access the internet, it is increasingly important to provide a fast website experience on mobile devices, as slow load times on mobile can lead to higher bounce rates and lower engagement.
