### SSR or SSG

SSR(Server Side Rendering) or SSG(Static Site Generation) is a way to render your website.
SSR is a way to render your website on the server, and SSG is a way to render your website on the build time.

We choose SSG because we want to build a website that we can pay less for hosting, and should load faster to avoid unnecessary network calls from the server.
How to reduce JavaScript code size?  This is another reason why we choose Astro: ship Less JavaScript and more HTML.
