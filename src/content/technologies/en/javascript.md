JavaScript/TypeScript is the most popular development language, and this trend is unlikely to change anytime soon. We recommend that customers adopt a JS/TS-based full-stack technology architecture for some start-ups or innovative projects, and we do the same. On the one hand, development efficiency is excellent. Furthermore, the hosting, operation, and maintenance cost are very low because of the improved support for JS/WebAssembly on the serverless platform.
